The goal of this project is to give you hands-on experience with lexical

analysis. You will extend the provided lexical analyzer to support more

token types. The next section lists all new token types that you need to

implement.

1. Token Types

Modify the lexer to support the following 3 token types:

REALNUM = NUM DOT digit digit*

BASE08NUM = ((pdigit8 digit8*) + 0) (x) (08)

BASE16NUM = ((pdigit16 digit16*) + 0) (x) (16)

Where

digit16 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + A + B + C + D + E + F

pdigit16 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + A + B + C + D + E + F

digit = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9

pdigit = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9

digit8 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7

pdigit8 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7

Note that NUM and DOT are already defined in the lexer, but here are

the regular expressions for the sake of completeness:

NUM = (pdigit digit*) + 0

DOT = â€˜.â€™

Note that DOT is a single dot character, the quotes are used to avoid

ambiguity.

The list of valid tokens including the existing tokens in the code would

be as follows:

IF

WHILE

DO

THEN

PRINT

PLUS

MINUS

DIV

MULT

EQUAL

COLON

COMMA

SEMICOLON

LBRAC

RBRAC

LPAREN

RPAREN

NOTEQUAL

GREATER

LESS

LTEQ

GTEQ

DOT

NUM

ID

REALNUM

BASE08NUM

BASE16NUM

This list should be used to determine the token if the input matches

more than one regular expression.

2. How-To

Follow these steps:

Download the lexer.cc , lexer.h , inputbuf.cc and inputbuf.h files

accompanying this project description. Note that these files might

be a little different than the code youâ€™ve seen in class or

elsewhere.

Add your code to the files to support the token types listed in the

previous section.

Compile your code using GCC compiler on CentOS 6.7 . You will need

to use the g++ command to compile your code in a terminal window.

Note that you are required to compile and test your code in CentOS

6.7 using the GCC compilers. You are free to use any IDE or text

editor on any platform, however, using tools available in CentOS

(or tools that you could install on CentOS could save time in the

development/compile/test cycle. See next section for more details

on how to compile using GCC.

Test your code to see if it passes the provided test cases. You

will need to extract the test cases from the zip file and run the

test script test1.sh . More details on this in the next section.

Submit your code in canvas before the deadline:

3. Compile &amp; Test

3.1 Compiling Code with GCC

You should compile your programs with the GCC compilers which are

available in CentOS 6.7. The GCC is a collection of compilers for many

programming languages. There are separate commands for compiling C and

C++ programs:

Use gcc command to compile C programs

Use g++ to compile C++ programs

Here is an example of how to compile a simple C++ program:

$ g++ test_program.cpp

If the compilation is successful, gcc will generate an executable file

named a.out in the same folder as the program. You can change the output

file name by specifying the -o switch:

$ g++ test_program.cpp -o hello.out

To enable all warning messages of the GCC compiler, use the -Wall

switch:

$ g++ -Wall test_program.cpp -o hello.out

The same options can be used with gcc to compile C programs.

Compiling projects with multiple files

If your program is written in multiple source files that should be

linked together, you can compile and link all files together with one

command:

$ g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp

Or you can compile them separately and then link:

$ g++ -c file1.cpp

$ g++ -c file2.cpp

$ g++ -c file3.cpp

$ g++ file1.o file2.o file3.o

The files with the .o extension are object files but are not

executable. They are linked together with the last statement and the

final executable will be a.out .

NOTE: you can replace g++ with gcc in all examples listed above to

compile C programs.

3.2 Testing your code with I/O Redirection

Your programs should not explicitly open any file. You can only use the

standard input e.g. std::cin in C++, getchar() , scanf() in C and

standard output e.g. std::cout in C++, putchar() , printf() in C for

input/output.

However, this restriction does not limit our ability to feed input to

the program from files nor does it mean that we cannot save the output

of the program in a file. We use a technique called standard IO

redirection to achieve this.

Suppose we have an executable program a.out , we can run it by issuing

the following command in a terminal (the dollar sign is not part of the

command):

$ ./a.out

If the program expects any input, it waits for it to be typed on the

keyboard and any output generated by the program will be displayed on

the terminal screen.

Now to feed input to the program from a file, we can redirect the

standard input to a file:

$ ./a.out &lt; input_data.txt

Now, the program will not wait for keyboard input, but rather read its

input from the specified file. We can redirect the output of the program

as well:

$ ./a.out &gt; output_file.txt

In this way, no output will be shown in the terminal window, but rather

it will be saved to the specified file. Note that programs have access

to another standard interface which is called standard error e.g.

std::cerr in C++, fprintf(stderr, â€¦) in C. Any such output is still

displayed on the terminal screen. However, it is possible to redirect

standard error to a file as well, but we will not discuss that here.

Finally, itâ€™s possible to mix both into one command:

$ ./a.out &lt; input_data.txt &gt; output_file.txt

Which will redirect standard input and standard output to input_data.txt

and output_file.txt respectively.

Now that we know how to use standard IO redirection, we are ready to

test the program with test cases.

Test Cases

A test case is an input and output specification. For a given input

there is an expected output. A test case for our purposes is usually

represented by two files:

test_name.txt

test_name.txt.expected

The input is given in test_name.txt and the expected output is given in

test_name.txt.expected .

To test a program against a single test case, first we execute the

program with the test input data:

$ ./a.out &lt; test_name.txt &gt; program_output.txt

The output generated by the program will be stored in program_output.txt .

To see if the program generated the expected output, we need to compare

program_output.txt and test_name.txt.expected . We do that using a general

purpose tool called diff :

$ diff -Bw program_output.txt test_name.txt.expected

The options -Bw tells diff to ignore whitespace differences between the

two files. If the files are the same (ignoring the whitespace

differences), we should see no output from diff , otherwise, diff will

produce a report showing the differences between the two files.

We would simply consider the test passed if diff could not find any

differences, otherwise we consider the test failed.

Our grading system uses this method to test your submissions against

multiple test cases. There is also a test script accompanying this

project test1.sh which will make your life easier by testing your code

against multiple test cases with one command.

Here is how to use test1.sh to test your program:

Store the provided test cases zip file in the same folder as your

project source files

Open a terminal window and navigate to your project folder using

cd command

Unzip the test archive using the unzip command:

$ unzip test_cases.zip

NOTE: the actual file name is probably different, you should

replace test_cases.zip with the correct file name.

Store the test1.sh script in your project directory as well

Mark the script as executable once you download it:

$ chmod +x test1.sh

Compile your program. The test script assumes your executable is

called a.out

Run the script to test your code:

$ ./test1.sh

The output of the script should be self explanatory. To test your code

after each change, you will just perform the last two steps afterwards.

4. Requirements

Here are the requirements of this project:

You should submit your code on the course submission website, no

other submission forms will be accepted.

You should use C/C++, no other programming languages are allowed.

You should familiarize yourself with the CentOS environment and the

GCC compiler. Programming assignments in this course might be very

different from what you are used to in other classes.
